	* Variables: A variable is a type of container that can hold different types of values that may change over time. A variable may contain a single letter or number, or a series of characters (like strings), or a collection of different items (like an array). Variables can also hold the results of calculations performed using other variables. 

	* Strings: A string is a collection of characters and/or numbers that is treated like a single text entity. In JavaScript, strings are always enclosed within single or double quotes. If a series of numbers is enclosed within quotes, it is treated as if it were text, that is, you cannot perform numerical operations with it. For example, 'Hello world!', "123456", "Alpha4" etc.

	* Functions (arguments, `return`): A function is a collection of commands or calculations that can be executed to perform a well-defined task. Arguments are values that can be sent to the function and which the function can use to perform the commands listed within it. The `return` command returns the results of the calculations performed within the function.

	* `if` statements: `if` statements are used to define conditional commands that take place only if a pre-defined condition has been met, and if not, a different set of commands can be provided in the program.

	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`): Boolean values are values that can have one of only two possible values at any given time. They can either be `true` or `false`.
